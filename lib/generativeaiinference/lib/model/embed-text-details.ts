/**
 * Generative AI Service Inference API
 * OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings. 

Use the Generative AI service inference API to access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to [chat](#/EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/ChatResult/Chat), [generate text](#/EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/GenerateTextResult/GenerateText), [summarize](#/EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/SummarizeTextResult/SummarizeText), and [create text embeddings](#/EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/EmbedTextResult/EmbedText).

To use a Generative AI custom model for inference, you must first create an endpoint for that model. Use the [Generative AI service management API](#/EN/generative-ai/latest/) to [create a custom model](#/EN/generative-ai/latest/Model/) by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model, or a previous version of a custom model, using your own data. Fine-tune the custom model on a [fine-tuning dedicated AI cluster](#/EN/generative-ai/latest/DedicatedAiCluster/). Then, create a [hosting dedicated AI cluster](#/EN/generative-ai/latest/DedicatedAiCluster/) with an [endpoint](#/en/generative-ai/latest/Endpoint/) to host your custom model. For resource management in the Generative AI service, use the [Generative AI service management API](#/EN/generative-ai/latest/).

To learn more about the service, see the [Generative AI documentation](/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm).
